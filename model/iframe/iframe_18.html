        <h2>MOBILE APPLICATION CREATION</h2>
        <p style="float: right;"><img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 10px;" src="../../style/images/application.jpeg" alt=""></p>
        <p>This project aimed to familiarize myself with app development through a simple example: creating an application to keep track of the books I have read.
            <br><br>
            I selected a suitable development platform, such as Android or iOS, and utilized the appropriate programming languages like Java, Kotlin, or Swift. 
            Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Android Studio or Xcode were used to facilitate the application creation process.
            As the project progressed, I designed a user-friendly interface with screens for adding, displaying, and organizing books according to my preferences.
            Graphical elements such as lists, forms, and buttons were incorporated to ensure smooth interaction with the application.</p>
        <p>Regarding functionality, I implemented mechanisms to input book details such as title, author, genre, and optional personal notes or comments. 
            Additionally, I integrated search and filtering features to enhance navigation and book management within the application.
            <br>
            In parallel, I ensured the secure storage of book data using appropriate methods such as local databases or the cloud. 
            This allowed convenient access to book information, even when switching devices or reinstalling the application.
            <br>
            This project provided valuable experience in application development, allowing me to apply my programming, user interface design, and data management skills. 
            It also allowed me to explore the end-to-end development process from initial design to implementation and deployment.
            <br>
            Ultimately, this book tracking application has become a useful personal tool for organizing my reading and sharing recommendations with fellow book enthusiasts. 
            It represents a significant milestone in my app development journey, motivating me to continue exploring new projects and expanding my skills in this exciting field.</p>
