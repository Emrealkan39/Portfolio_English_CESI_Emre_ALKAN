    <h2>Creation of a compagny safety training site</h2>
    <p style="float: right;"><img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 5px;" src="../../style/images/Site_Formation.png"></p>
    <p>The company where I'm doing my apprenticeship wants to create a website that would be used to train newcomers to the company. 
        The procedure is as follows: once the user has been accepted by the company, whether for an internship, a temporary assignment or as a new employee, 
        the human resources manager will create the user's account on a web page available only to her, so that he can follow his training. Once the account has been created, 
        the user will receive an e-mail with their login details, inviting them to follow the training course on the website.</p>
    <p>Then, depending on whether the user is an employee, a temporary worker or a trainee, and on the workshop in which he or she will be working, he or she will follow a training course. 
        The training course the user will follow will differ according to the information the human resources manager enters when creating the account. Indeed, the safety rules to be observed
        by employees are not the same from one workshop to another.</p>
