        <p>During this project, we initially had the architecture of an information system of a company that was going to be acquired. However, this infrastructure was very rudimentary, 
            so it needed to be modified in order to comply with current security standards.</p>
        <p>To do this, we started by setting up an Active Directory to enable all employees to log into their sessions on the various computers of the company.
            <br>
        <p>Next, we had to set up a firewall as well as VPNs, and other security measures in order to secure our network against threats that could come from the outside.</p>
        <p>Finally, we had to implement containerization on our network so that certain applications could be available for employees on their sessions, such as the company's 
            internal software or a monitoring system to oversee the performance of our information system.
        <br>
        <p>We also had to set up a backup plan for our company in order to prevent various risks that could occur on our network, and to establish measures for resuming activity as quickly as possible.</p>
