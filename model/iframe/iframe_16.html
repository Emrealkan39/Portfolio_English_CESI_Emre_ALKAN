        <h2>PENTESTING CERTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>This project is still ongoing, and I am currently undergoing training in cybersecurity, specifically in the field of pentesting. 
            I am actively following the TryHackMe training program, which allows me to explore the world of cybersecurity and work towards obtaining a certification.
            <br>
            In this training program, I am discovering the role of a pentester and all the responsibilities it entails, including both computer and physical security, 
            conducting network attacks to identify vulnerabilities, and more.</p>
        <p>Throughout the course, I am learning various methods employed by pentesters to identify network vulnerabilities through different practical examples, 
            such as simulated websites, mock computer networks, and various other scenarios.
            <br>
            This training program is highly intriguing as it provides comprehensive explanations of all aspects of the profession. 
            It enables me to acquire the necessary skills to assess the security of computer systems from design to implementation. 
            I am deepening my knowledge in security auditing, cryptography, defense against attacks, and other crucial areas of cybersecurity.
            <br>
            Through this training, I am developing a thorough understanding of the challenges related to computer security, 
            learning to anticipate and counter potential attacks. Ultimately, this expertise will allow me to contribute to the protection of systems and networks against the increasing 
            threats we face in today's digital world.</p>
