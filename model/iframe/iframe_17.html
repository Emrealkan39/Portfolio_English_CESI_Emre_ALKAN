        <h2>BADGE DOOR LOCK</h2>
        <p style="float: right;"><img style="width: 300px;" src="../../style/images/rfid.jpeg"></p>
        <p>This is the very first project I independently undertook. The goal was to utilize an RFID sensor and an Arduino board to read data from a card 
            and verify its authenticity in order to open a door.
            <br>
            <br>
            For this project, I learned how to connect the RFID sensor to the Arduino and program the microcontroller to interact with the sensor and process the read data. 
            I also implemented a verification system to determine if the card's information matched any pre-established list of authorized cards. If the card was recognized,
            the system would activate a mechanism to open the door.</p>
        <p>This project allowed me to acquire technical skills in electronics and programming. I learned how to manipulate hardware components, 
            understand the specifications of the RFID sensor, and utilize the appropriate software libraries to interface with it. 
            I deepened my knowledge of Arduino programming, using conditional structures to verify the card data and implementing actions based on the obtained result.
            <br>
            <br>
            Completing this project provided valuable hands-on experience and helped me grasp the fundamental principles of interaction between RFID sensors and microcontrollers. 
            It also laid a solid foundation for tackling more complex projects in the fields of automation and security.
            <br>
            <br>
            This initial personal project was an enriching experience that motivated me to further explore the vast realm of electronics and programming. 
            I look forward to continuing my learning journey and taking on new challenges with future projects.</p>
