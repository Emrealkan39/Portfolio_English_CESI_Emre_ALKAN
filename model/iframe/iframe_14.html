        <p>The aim of this project was to create a website that would help students in their 2áµ‰ year at CESI with their internship searches. </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>On this site, there were several types of account: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There was the account reserved for students, who could search for the various internship offers available. They could also add internships to their wish list, apply for them and check the progress of their applications. </li>
            <li>There were accounts for class leaders who could not only apply for jobs, but also view the progress of each of their students. </li>
            <li>There were accounts for companies who could post internship offers on the platform, which would then be made available to students. </li>
            <li>And finally, there was the website administrator's account, which could add, delete or modify accounts, offers, etc... </li>
        </ul>
